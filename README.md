1. A Preface to the Esteemed Players
----------------
Armchair-General is a contest of dominion and cunning, inspired by the noble diversions of the salons and war rooms of Europe. Herein, you shall assume the mantle of a sovereign, vying for supremacy upon a map of many lands, commanding armies, fortifying your realms, and managing your treasury with prudence and foresight.


2. The Object of the Game
------------------
The aim, most illustrious, is not the mere annihilation of your rivals, but the attainment of preeminence through wealth. Victory is bestowed upon the first to command four-fifths (80%) of the total income derived from all lands and players. Let it be known: it is the purse, not the sword alone, that secures the crown.


3. The Implements of Play
-------------------
- **Countries**: Territories upon the map, each awaiting the hand of a master.
- **Players**: Worthy adversaries, be they of flesh and blood or the mechanical mind (the latter, a marvel of our age).
- **Armies**: Regiments and battalions, the instruments of your will.
- **Money**: The sinews of war, to be spent with care.
- **Turns**: The passage of time, measured in rounds, each player acting in their due order.


4. The Course of Play
------------------
At the commencement, each sovereign is granted dominion over certain lands, a modest treasury, and a contingent of troops.
Upon your turn, you may undertake up to five actions—no more, lest chaos reign. These may include the raising of armies, the strengthening of fortifications, the movement of troops, the launching of assaults, and other stratagems.
When all have acted, the round concludes, and a new one begins. The contest endures until a single player commands the requisite share of the world’s income.


5. On Actions & Their Execution
-----------------------
- **Buy Armies**: Expend coin to muster new regiments in your lands.
- **Fortify**: Invest in the strengthening of a country’s defenses; such works require time and are not completed in an instant.
- **Move Armies**: Dispatch your forces from one friendly land to another, provided they are neighbors or have an ocean connection.
- **Attack**: Attempt the conquest of a rival’s country. The further your troops must march, the weaker their resolve; distance diminishes strength.
  - Ordinarily, only adjacent lands may be attacked. Yet, should both possess a coast, a bold amphibious assault may be attempted, though the perils of the sea triple the effective distance.
- **Spy**: Dispatch agents to gather intelligence, if such means are at your disposal.
- **Income**: At the dawn of each round, your coffers are replenished according to your holdings.


6. The Board and Its Apparatus
---------------------------
- **Map Area**: A grand tableau displaying all lands, their masters, and the strength of their garrisons.
- **Country Selection**: Indicate your intentions by pointing to lands upon the map.
- **Action Buttons**: Upon selection, the appropriate options for your chosen lands shall present themselves.
  - For actions requiring two lands (such as movement or attack), select the origin and then the destination; the proper course will be made clear.


7. The Advisor
-------------
Seated at your right hand, you shall find your Advisor—a personage of wisdom and experience, ever ready to offer counsel. He surveys the field, weighs the fortunes of war, and whispers recommendations for your consideration. He is especially valuable to those new to the game, or to any who find themselves at a loss for their next move.
Heed him or not, as your own judgment dictates.
