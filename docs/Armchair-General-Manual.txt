1. Introduction
----------------
Armchair-General is a turn-based strategy game inspired by classic world domination board games. You play as a leader vying for control over a map of countries, managing armies, fortifications, and resources to outmaneuver your opponents.


2. Game Objective
------------------
The goal is to control 80% of the total income of all players. Income is generated by the countries you own. You win by accumulating enough territory and resources to reach this threshold, not necessarily by eliminating all opponents.


3. Game Components
-------------------
- **Countries**: Territories on the map that can be owned, fortified, and attacked.
- **Players**: Human or AI participants, each with their own resources and armies.
- **Armies**: Units used to defend and attack countries.
- **Money**: Used to buy armies and fortifications.
- **Turns**: The game progresses in rounds, with each player taking actions in turn.


4. Basic Gameplay
------------------
- At the start, each player controls a set of countries and receives a starting amount of money and armies.
- On your turn, you can perform up to 5 actions. Actions include buying armies, fortifying countries, moving armies, attacking opponents, and more. Plan your moves carefully, as you are limited to 5 actions per turn.
- After all players have taken their turn, the game advances to the next round.
- The game ends when one player controls 80% of the total income of all players.


5. Actions & Mechanics
-----------------------
- **Buy Armies**: Spend money to increase your armies in owned countries.
- **Fortify**: Spend money to plan a fortification for a country, which will be completed after a delay.
- **Move Armies**: Transfer armies between adjacent owned countries.
- **Attack**: Attempt to conquer an enemy country using your armies. The effectiveness of your attack is reduced by the distance between the centers of the attacking and defending countries—the greater the distance, the weaker your attack becomes. Normally, you can only attack neighboring (bordering) countries. However, if both countries have a coast, you may attack across water even if they do not share a border. When attacking across water, the distance is considered three times greater than the same distance across land, making such attacks significantly harder.
- **Spy**: Gather information about enemy countries (if available).
- **Income**: At the start of each turn, you receive money based on the countries you own.
- **Planned Fortifications**: Fortifications are not instant; they are scheduled and completed after a set number of turns.


6. User Interface Overview
---------------------------
- **Map Area**: The main view, showing all countries, their owners, and army counts.
- **Country Selection**: Click on countries to select them for actions.
- **Action Buttons**: Context-sensitive buttons appear for available actions (e.g., Fortify, Attack).
- **Dialogs**: Pop-up dialogs for entering amounts, confirming actions, or viewing logs.
- **Animations**: Visual effects for startup, attacks, fortifications, and special events.
